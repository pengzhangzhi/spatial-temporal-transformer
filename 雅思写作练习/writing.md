Overall, there are more male students than counterpart in most subjects.  The most studied subjects is natural sciences and the least one is lingusitics.Considering male students, the most studied subjects is mathematics and the least one is linguistics. For female students, the most one is natural sciences and the least is mathematics.

In natural sciences, there are qual number of students in terms of gender. while the subject of mathematics shows extremely  gap. Specifically, number of male students achieves 200 while the counterpart reachs out about 40.  The same stuation exists in enginnering, psychology, and programming. Numer of male students outperforms female students in all subjects except for linguistics, where the number outperforms 150 and in linguistics the number is less than 100.
